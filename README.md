This project started as an idea to be able to monitor and control my family's home garage through my phone from anywhere in the summer of 2019. This repository contains two implementations, one failed attempt with only a RaspberryPi and the Kivy framework, then two successful implementations with Node.js and an ESP32 microcontroller webserver. I followed these implementations with a Flask implementation in Python which can be seen in [eho99/garage-controller-ver2 (github.com)](https://github.com/eho99/garage-controller-ver2). 

An image of my breadboard setup from the RaspberryPi can be seen [breadboard.jpg](https://github.com/eho99/garage-controller/blob/main/breadboard.jpg).
